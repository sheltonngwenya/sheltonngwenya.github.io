		<h1>What is nutrition, and why does it matter?</h1>
		<p>Nutrition, nourishment, or aliment, is the supply of materials - food - required by organisms and cells to stay alive. In science and human medicine, nutrition is the science or practice of consuming and utilizing foods.</p>
		<p>The food we eat plays a vital role in how we look and feel. Regular exercise is important but according to research, nutrition has the largest impact on our fitness. Using food as our medicine has become a popular theme for health improvement.</p>
		<p>The trend is now to focus on healthy food intake as a primary fitness goal. When healthy eating habits become a lifestyle, we are healthier and happier. Eating right allows us to reduce body fat, lose a few pounds, feel more confident and reduce our risk of illness.</p>
		<p>Frequent studies are indicating healthy food intake as the most important part of our fitness programs. Some physicians are teaching healthy eating habits and lifestyle as a way to improve overall health by reducing obesity and related disease.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h2>What what ahould a person eat before,during, and after exercise?</h2>
		<p><b>Before</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have some high carbohydrate foods like bananas, bagels or fruit juices. These foods are broken down quickly and provide glucose to the muscles</li>
			<li>The timing of this meal depends on the persons preference for eating before exercise, but researchers have found that eating something from 1 to 4 hours before exercise helps keep plenty of blood glucose available for working muscles.</li>
			<li>It is also critical to drink plenty of cool water before exercise to keep muscles hydrated.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>During</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Perspiration and exertion deplete the body of fluids necessary for an optimal performance and lead to dehydration. It is important to drink plenty of cool water, <b>at least</b> a half a cup of water every 20 minutes of exercise. Adding a teaspoon of sugar, a little fruit juice or a small amount of powdered drink mix flavors plain water and may encourage fluid intake.</li>
			<li>Usually there is no need to worry about replacing carbohydrates unless the exercise <b>lasts over 90 minutes</b> and is <b>hard and continuous</b>. When this happens, drinking a sports drink or other beverage with some sugar in it will fuel and water to the muscles being exercised.</li>
			<li>Make a homemade sports drink by mixing no more than 4 teaspoon of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and some flavoring (like a teaspoon of lemon juice) in 8 ounces of water.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>After</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the exercise was strenuous and lasted a long time, glycogen stores may need refueling. Consuming foods and beverages high in carbohydrates right after exercise will replenish glycogen stores if they are low after exercising.</li>
			<li>No matter the intensity of the exercise, it's important to drink plenty of water and eat a nutritious, balanced meal that has lots of carbohydrate rich foods such as grains, pastas, potatoes, vegetables and fruits. A teaspoon of sugar, at only 15 calories* per teaspoon, adds flavor to these foods and may increase taste appeal</li>
		</ul>
